# POC:
# first find targets with the dork above and signup by uploading a normal photo in this step. then
# login(sometime it will login automatically) after that go to "My Photo" click on "Manage My photo"
# "Modify Photo 1" now upload your shell.php here :) open your profile photo(the shell you uploaded)
# url will be like this:
# http://sitedomain.com/photoprocess.php?image=memphoto1/209975shell.php&amp;square=100

# Now you are done :)
# 123456 is a random number that the website will add to your file name so it can be any thing else
#
# Bypass:
